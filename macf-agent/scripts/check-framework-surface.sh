# check-framework-surface.sh — Claude Code SessionStart hook (groundnuty/macf#814)
# that detects when the macf-distributed framework surface (the MCP plugin
# mount, the agent identity config, the guard-hook scripts) has been silently
# swept away by an untracked-sweeping git operation, and warns LOUDLY into the
# agent's context so it knows to run `macf update` to re-distribute.
#
# WHY (the real incident this is the safety net for): `.macf/plugin/`,
# `.macf/macf-agent.json`, `.macf/env.*`, and `.claude/scripts/check-*.sh` are
# ALL UNTRACKED in the consumer agent repo. A routine `git stash push -u`
# (or `git stash --include-untracked` / `-a` / `--all`) silently sweeps them
# into the stash; `git checkout` / a branch switch then leaves the working
# tree without them; `git stash show -p` HIDES the untracked portion of a
# stash (so a swept stash still looks "safe" — only tracked-file diffs show);
# `git stash drop` then PERMANENTLY deletes the payload, unrecoverable via
# git. `git clean -fd` (or any force+directories combo) does the same damage
# directly, no stash involved. The resulting damage: no MCP plugin
# (notify_peer / channel tools gone), no identity config (`macf-agent.json`,
# so a clean relaunch fails), and — worst — every PreToolUse/PostToolUse
# guard hook gone. Those hooks fail NON-BLOCKING when their script is
# missing (Claude Code just can't find the command), so the agent keeps
# running SILENTLY UNGUARDED: no attribution-trap / mention-routing / lgtm /
# close-keyword checks, and nothing announces the gap. See
# groundnuty/macf#814 for the full incident writeup.
#
# This hook is the DETECT half of the #814 combination. The PREVENT half is
# `check-git-sweep.sh`, a PreToolUse hook that blocks the sweeping git
# commands themselves at the moment they'd run. Together: prevent the sweep
# where possible, and self-heal-detect (this hook) when a sweep already
# happened via some other path (a hand-run command outside a Bash tool call,
# an older workspace pre-dating check-git-sweep.sh, etc.).
#
# This mirrors `macf doctor`'s existing bad-stash / hooks-floor detection
# (DR-039 Decision 1 — `doctor.ts` `DR039_LOAD_BEARING_HOOKS`), but runs
# UNCONDITIONALLY at every session start instead of only on a manual
# `macf doctor` invocation — the same Path-2 "a recurring discipline gets
# promoted to a deterministic harness mechanism" shape as the check-*.sh
# family (silent-fallback-hazards.md).
#
# Hook contract (SessionStart): JSON on stdin; STDOUT is injected into the
# agent's context on exit 0 (same mechanism check-channel-alive.sh /
# check-channels-enabled.sh use). This hook is OBSERVATIONAL + NON-BLOCKING:
# it does NOT attempt repair — no auto `macf update` (that would be a
# surprising, slow, network-touching side effect buried inside a SessionStart
# hook) — and it ALWAYS exits 0. Override: MACF_SKIP_FRAMEWORK_CHECK=1.
#
# DELIBERATELY matcher-less (groundnuty/macf#930 audit — kept, not an
# oversight): unlike the work-pickup hook (macf-startup-pickup.sh, narrowed
# to `matcher: "startup"` by #930), this guard's whole purpose is catching a
# sweep that happened via some OTHER path mid-session (a hand-run command
# outside a Bash tool call, per the WHY above) — the earliest re-check
# opportunity after such a sweep may be a `compact`/`resume`/`clear`/`fork`,
# not a fresh `startup`. Restricting this hook to `startup` would reopen the
# exact detection gap #814 closed. It stays silent (no stdout) unless
# something is actually swept, so it doesn't share #930's noise/subagent
# concern in the first place.
#
# FALSE-WARN GUARD: a bare checkout of `groundnuty/macf` itself (the
# framework source repo), or any workspace that was simply never
# `macf init`'d, legitimately has none of `.macf/plugin`,
# `.macf/macf-agent.json`, or `.claude/scripts/check-*.sh` — that is NOT
# damage, it's just never having been initialized. This hook only evaluates
# the checks below when the workspace shows INDEPENDENT evidence of being a
# MANAGED workspace (a `.macf/` directory exists, OR `.claude/settings.json`
# exists) — a workspace with neither marker is skipped entirely, silently.
#
# WORKTREE FALSE-ALARM GUARD (groundnuty/macf#1114): a `git worktree add`
# linked worktree — the shape `Agent(isolation: "worktree")` workers use
# (`agent-identity.md` "Parallel Issue Execution with Teams") — is ANOTHER
# legitimately-never-had-the-surface case, distinct from the bare-checkout
# case above but the same NOT-damage shape. `.macf/` (the plugin mount +
# `macf-agent.json`) is workspace-local + gitignored (see this repo's own
# `.gitignore`), so it exists ONLY in the primary checkout — a linked
# worktree's working directory never receives it, by design, regardless of
# whether the worktree also happens to check out tracked files (like this
# repo's own committed `.claude/settings.json` + `.claude/scripts/check-*.sh`
# — groundnuty/macf dogfoods itself, so those two ARE tracked here even
# though the file-header WHY above documents them as untracked in a generic
# `macf init`'d consumer repo). Concretely: EVERY worker spawned during the
# #1114 investigation session reported `.macf/plugin/` + `macf-agent.json`
# missing — a surface that was never damaged, just never present in that
# checkout.
#
# DISCRIMINATOR: the SAME predicate as groundnuty/macf#1042 / #1113
# (`macf-startup-pickup.sh`'s own linked-worktree no-op) — adapted to this
# file's single-bracket `[ ]` style (vs. that script's `[[ ]]`), but not
# re-derived: two independent implementations of "am I a worker" would
# drift silently. `.git` is a property of the CHECKOUT, not the
# environment: git writes a FILE (a `gitdir: ...` pointer) for a linked
# worktree and a real DIRECTORY for the primary checkout. Unlike
# `MACF_AGENT_TYPE`, `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION`, or `$TMUX` — all three
# verified (in #1042) to be inherited byte-for-byte into a worker, because
# the spawner forks the parent's full environment — `.git`'s shape cannot
# be inherited across a fork; it is read fresh from whatever directory the
# check runs in. THE PREMISE THIS RESTS ON (stated explicitly, as #1113
# did): a permanent agent's registered workspace is ALWAYS the primary
# clone — no supported pattern in this repo runs a permanent fleet agent
# out of a linked worktree. If that ever stops being true, this check
# breaks and needs revisiting alongside whatever introduces the exception.
# (A git SUBMODULE's `.git` is also a `gitdir: ...` pointer file — a third
# shape matching this marker, neither a linked worktree nor a primary
# clone. #1113 carries the identical exposure; noting it here rather than
# changing behavior, since no supported pattern runs a permanent agent out
# of a submodule checkout either.)
#
# FAIL-OPEN DIRECTION IS INVERTED FROM #1042 — same discriminator, OPPOSITE
# conclusion, and it must be reasoned here, not inherited: #1042's hook
# guards a QUEUE-INJECTION nudge, where a wrong guess means a fleet silently
# stops picking up work, so ambiguity there resolves to INJECT (act). THIS
# hook guards a SECURITY-relevant DAMAGE ALARM, where a wrong guess means
# missing a genuine sweep (the #814 incident this hook exists to catch), so
# ambiguity here resolves to ALARM (warn) — the opposite default. Concretely:
# ONLY a CONFIRMED worker shape (`.git` is a file whose content matches
# `^gitdir: `) suppresses the checks below. `.git` absent, a directory,
# unreadable, or any other unrecognized shape is INDETERMINATE and falls
# through to the checks below UNCHANGED — they still run, and still alarm
# if the surface is genuinely missing. A missed suppression is recoverable
# noise (one worker prints a warning it didn't need to); a wrongly-suppressed
# alarm on a genuinely swept primary checkout is not.

cat <<WARN
⚠️  MACF FRAMEWORK SURFACE IS DAMAGED (groundnuty/macf#814) — untracked
files are missing from this workspace:

$(printf '  - %s\n' "${MISSING[@]}")

This usually means a routine git operation silently swept + destroyed these
files — they are UNTRACKED, so \`git stash push -u\` / \`git stash
--include-untracked\` / \`git stash -a\` / \`git stash --all\` / \`git clean
-fd\` all sweep them. \`git stash show -p\` HIDES the untracked portion of a
stash (so a swept stash still looks "safe" — only the tracked-file diff
shows), which is how the sweep goes unnoticed until \`git stash drop\`
permanently deletes it. See groundnuty/macf#814 for the full incident.

Run \`macf update\` to re-distribute the framework files (they are
regenerated from the CLI package, not recovered from git — a swept
untracked payload is not git-recoverable). This guard is observational-only
— it does NOT auto-repair and cannot run \`macf update\` for you.

Silence: MACF_SKIP_FRAMEWORK_CHECK=1.
